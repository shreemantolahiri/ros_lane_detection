# ros_lane_detection
gazebo simulation of lane detection using ebot

I have used world from aws-robomaker-challenge and made the ebot follow lane detection.
There are two approaches/methods:
*Hough Lines Transforms*
*FindContour*
You can find both of them in the **lane** folder.

To launch the ebot in the world run.
```roslaunch <package name> my_bot.launch```
